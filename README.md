**Car Price Prediction**

This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars based on various factors such as year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and selling type. The dataset used for this project is the 'car data.csv' file.

**Installation**
To run this project, you will need to install the following libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

sklearn

You can install these libraries using pip:

**bash**

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn

**Usage**

To run the project, simply open the 'car_price_prediction.ipynb' file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and execute the cells.

**Data Exploration**

The project starts with exploring the dataset to understand its characteristics and identify any potential issues. This includes checking for missing values, duplicates, and the distribution of categorical data.

**Data Preprocessing**

The project then performs data preprocessing to prepare the data for modeling. This includes encoding categorical variables and checking for outliers.

**Data Visualization**

The project uses various data visualization techniques to gain insights into the relationships between different variables and the target variable (selling price). This includes pairplots, boxplots, and a heatmap of correlations.

**Model Training**

The project uses a decision tree regression model to predict the selling price of used cars. The model is trained on 90% of the data and evaluated on the remaining 10%.

**Model Evaluation**

The project evaluates the performance of the model using mean absolute error (MAE) and R-squared error. The MAE is 2.54 and the R-squared error is 0.85, indicating that the model is able to predict the selling price of used cars with reasonable accuracy.

**Conclusion**
The project demonstrates the use of data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, and modeling techniques to predict the selling price of used cars. The decision tree regression model achieves good performance on the given dataset.
